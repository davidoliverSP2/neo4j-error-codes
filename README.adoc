== Installation

To build these docs locally you will need link:https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/[Node & NPM^] installed.

To install the dependencies run:

[source,sh]
npm install


== Live Preview

To preview the docs, run:

[source,sh]
npm run dev


This will build a set of HTML files in `build/site` and then serve them through an express server at http://localhost:8000.
The dev script will also listen for changes and automatically rebuild the files automatically.
You'll still need to refresh the page to view the changes.


== Publishing

Pushing to the `publish` branch of this repo will trigger a rebuild of the HTML and CSS files in the link:https://github.com/neo4j-documentation/docs-refresh[Docs Refresh^] repo using a Github Action.


[source,sh]
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-documentation/labs-pages
git add .
git commit -m "My changes"
git push origin HEAD:publish

At the end of the build process, the files are uploaded to the `static-content.neo4j.com` S3 Bucket.  From there, they are synced up to the Neo4j.com server once an hour, on the hour by a cronjob.

== Pre-processing hints

Migrating https://neo4j.com/docs/status-codes/current/ HTML to individual adoc pages...

1. save as source HTML
2. convert to adoc using pandoc `pandoc --wrap=none -f html -t asciidoc neo4j-status-codes.html > codes.adoc`
3. edit by hand to trim down to the `|` delimited table
4. process that into individual pages `csvcut -c 1,2 -d "|" codes.csv | csvformat -U 1 -D " " | xargs -n2 sh -c 'echo "$2\n" > tmp/$1.adoc' sh`
